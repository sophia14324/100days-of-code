# Fidget Spinner

* The code uses the Python turtle module to create an animation of a fidget spinner.

* A dictionary called state is used to track the rotation angle of the fidget spinner.

* The spinner() function draws the spinner by rotating and placing dots of different colors.

* The animate() function gradually reduces the rotation angle to create the spinning effect.

* The flick() function increases the rotation angle when the spacebar is pressed.

* The code configures the graphics window, sets up event handling for the spacebar, and starts the animation loop.
