# The Quick Sort Algorithm

* Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that follows a divide-and-conquer approach.
* The algorithm selects a pivot element from the array.
* It partitions the remaining elements into two subarrays: one with elements less than or equal to the pivot, and another with elements greater than the pivot.
* The algorithm recursively applies the quick sort algorithm to the subarrays.
* Finally, it combines the sorted subarrays with the pivot element to obtain the final sorted array.
* Quick sort has an average case time complexity of O(n log n), which makes it efficient for sorting large datasets.
