# Simulating The Monty Hall Problem

## The algorithm used

* Set up a game show with three doors, where one door holds a valuable prize (car or vacation), and the other two doors have worthless prizes (goats or zonks).

* The contestant initially selects one door at random, with no knowledge of the location of the prize.

* The host, Monty Hall, opens one of the unchosen doors to reveal a worthless prize (goat/zonk).

* Monty Hall always chooses a door with a worthless prize behind it, creating an opportunity for the contestant to potentially switch their choice.

* The contestant decides whether to stick with their initial choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.

* The contestant's choice to stick or switch determines their final chosen door.

* The final chosen door is revealed, and the contestant receives the prize behind it, whether it's the valuable prize or a worthless prize.
