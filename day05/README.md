# The binary search algorithm 

The binary search algorithm implemented in this code searches for a target item within a sorted sequence by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It utilizes index variables to keep track of the search range and a midpoint to compare the target item with the value at that position. Based on the comparison, the search range is adjusted until the item is found or determined to be absent. The algorithm returns the index of the item if found, or None if the item is not present in the sequence.
