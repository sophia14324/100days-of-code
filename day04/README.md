# The Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting with 0 and 1. In the given Python code, the Fibonacci sequence is generated using a for loop and variables a, b, and c. The loop iterates from 2 to the specified number of terms, and in each iteration, the next Fibonacci number is calculated by adding the previous two numbers (a and b). The sequence is then printed, with an early exit condition if a Fibonacci number exceeds 100.

## Concepts Practiced:

* User Input Function
* Type Conversion i.e., using int() to perform calculations.
* Conditional Statements
* The For Loop
* Variable Assignment and Updating: The code utilizes variables a, b, and c to store and update the Fibonacci numbers in each iteration.
* Break Statements
* Function Definition and Invocation: The code defines a function fibo() to generate the Fibonacci series and invokes it with the user's input value.
